This is a SimpleMemory with DMI using GreenLib.

How to include this model in a project:

* Copy the misc/FindSIMPLEMEMORY.cmake in your project repository.
* Add the following lines into your CMakeLists.txt:
    FIND_PACKAGE(SIMPLEMEMORY)
    if(SIMPLEMEMORY_FOUND)
      INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${SIMPLEMEMORY_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    else()
      MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR "SimpleMemory not found.")
    endif()

You're now able to use SimpleMemory headers.
